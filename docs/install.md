# Installing DBDelve

## macOS

Apple Silicon, macOS 12 or later — that's what it's built and tested on. Intel
and older macOS aren't blocked by anything in the code, they're just untested.

Homebrew is the recommended way. It handles installing and upgrading:

```sh
brew install --cask ShayanAbbas1/dbdelve/dbdelve
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DBDelve.app
```

Don't skip the second line, or macOS will refuse to open the app. DBDelve is
signed ad-hoc: there's no Developer ID behind it and nothing is notarized, so
Gatekeeper declines until the quarantine flag is cleared.

Your connections and query history are kept outside the app and survive updates.
macOS will ask once more for the saved passwords in your Keychain after each
update, because each release carries a different ad-hoc signature. I'll
pay for a Developer ID if enough people end up using this, which removes all of
the above.

Failing Homebrew, take the `.dmg` from [the latest release][releases] and drag
DBDelve to Applications. Same quarantine step and you have to update manually.

To build it yourself instead, `DBDELVE_CHANNEL=release dev/bundle.sh` produces
`target/DBDelve.app` with the release build, icon and signature. Drag that to
Applications; the quarantine step doesn't apply here.

## Linux

Install from the AUR:

```sh
yay -S dbdelve-bin
```

It's maintained by
[@0PandaDEV](https://github.com/0PandaDEV), not by this project. Thanks for
packaging it!

A tarball or an AppImage, x86_64 or aarch64, built on Ubuntu 22.04 — that is
the oldest glibc either will run against, so anything at least that new is
fine. X11 and Wayland both work, and you need a Vulkan or OpenGL driver, a
Secret Service keyring (gnome-keyring or KWallet) for saved passwords, and
xdg-desktop-portal for the export dialog.

Take `dbdelve-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` from [the latest release][releases]
and run the `install.sh` inside it:

```sh
tar xzf dbdelve-*-linux-*.tar.gz
cd dbdelve-*-linux-*/
./install.sh
```

Everything goes under `~/.local`, so no root: the binary to `~/.local/bin`, the
icons and the desktop entry where your desktop looks for them, which is what
puts DBDelve in the app menu. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your PATH —
`install.sh` says so if it isn't. Updating means unpacking the next release and
running it again; `./install.sh --uninstall` reverses it and leaves your
connections and query history alone.

Or take `dbdelve-<version>-<arch>.AppImage` from the same release, which is one
file that runs where it lands:

```sh
chmod +x dbdelve-*.AppImage
./dbdelve-*.AppImage
```

It carries the libraries that are safe to carry and takes the graphics drivers
from your machine, so it runs on distributions either side of the one it was
built on. Running any AppImage needs FUSE 2, which Ubuntu 22.04 and later no
longer install — `sudo apt install libfuse2`, or `libfuse2t64` on 24.04 and
later, is usually the only thing missing. Failing that,
`./dbdelve-*.AppImage --appimage-extract` unpacks it and `squashfs-root/AppRun`
runs it with no FUSE at all.

What it does not do is put DBDelve in the app menu: an AppImage on its own is
just a file you run, so there is no desktop entry and no icon until you
integrate it — Gear Lever and AppImageLauncher both do that, or you copy the
entry out by hand. The tarball does it for you, which is still the reason to
prefer it. Updating either way is downloading the next one.

To build it yourself instead, on Debian or Ubuntu the build needs:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config cmake libfontconfig-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libwayland-dev libdbus-1-dev
cargo build --release
```

The binary lands at `target/release/dbdelve` and runs from anywhere;
`dev/package-linux.sh` wraps that same build into the tarball above and
`dev/package-appimage.sh` into the AppImage. Connections and query history go
to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dbdelve`, or `~/.local/share/dbdelve`.

## Windows

A zip, x86_64, from [the latest release][releases]. Unzip it and run
`dbdelve.exe`. Nothing is installed. There is no installer.

To build it yourself instead, the build needs the MSVC toolchain and the
Windows SDK, which is what compiles the bundled SQLite and GPUI's shaders:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The binary is `target\release\dbdelve.exe`. Connections and query history go
to `%APPDATA%\dbdelve`. Passwords go in Credential Manager. The window draws
its own title bar, buttons included. Chords are the same as macOS with Ctrl in
place of Cmd.

## Updating

`brew upgrade --cask dbdelve`, if you installed it that way. Otherwise the
status bar links to [the latest release][releases] once there is a newer one.

There is no telemetry. The only request DBDelve makes on its own is one to
GitHub at startup to check for updates, which you can turn off in Settings.
